# spinrate-visual
Most of this was auto generated by: https://threejs.org/editor/
The only actual coding I did was writing a small script to spin the ball (which is now located in `app.json -> scripts`):
```javascript
// Pitch's rotation in radians per second
var spinRate = new THREE.Euler( 0.8, 0, -1.2, 'XYZ' );

function update( e ) {
	var deltaSeconds = e.delta / 1000;
	this.rotateX( spinRate.x * deltaSeconds )
	this.rotateY( spinRate.y * deltaSeconds )
	this.rotateZ( spinRate.z * deltaSeconds )
}
```

Alternatively if you only had spin axis and spin rate you could do something like this (untested and unimplemented):
```javascript
// Pitch's axis of rotation (should probably be normalized)
var spinAxis = new THREE.Vector3( -0.4, 0, 0.6 );

// Pitch's rotational speed in radians per second
var spinRate = 2;

function update( e ) {
	var deltaSeconds = e.delta / 1000;
	this.rotateOnAxis( spinAxis, spinRate * deltaSeconds )
}
```
